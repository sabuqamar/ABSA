30,Very crowded but we did get seated quickly. Barely any service. My meal was ok. It was fine… but nothing special! very busy area
50,"We love a HardRock Cafe and this one doesn’t disappoint either, lovely food, friendly staff. Great atmosphere to suit all for sure and on the way out a great gift shop to grab your merchandise. The restaurant/bar does get busy but considering it’s located at Times Square you can’t expect anything different-food was still served in a quick manner and didn’t feel crowded."
50,"My friend and I dinned at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square after a day of exploring around the city. We checked the website and the only available reservation was at 10:30. We decided to try our luck and see if we could get seats at the bar and we were able to walk right in and sit immediately. We were approached almost immediately and ordered drinks and food. The bartenders were helpful and hustling. The entire experience was above and beyond, especially with a fully packed restaurant! For NYC, the food prices are very reasonable and drinks are delicious! My friend order the nachos as her dinner and it was a huge portion. My burger was cooked perfect! Everyone in the giftshop were awesome as well. We will be back on future trips!"
50,Was staying at Hard Rock Hotel and to complete the experience we booked the Cafe for actual anniversary night. Lovely experience. Fajitas amazing and Luis brought us more tortillas. Cheeseburger was great. Tropical Margarita a must. Lovely ice cream surprise as we’d said it was our anniversary. Table was good and restaurant v busy. Bit strange to check in there were people milling about everywhere perhaps they were waiting for tables. The hosts were busy answering phone too and not that friendly but once in the restaurant staff were great. We booked online about a week before.
50,We was in NYC for our anniversary and whilst out there we decided to go in and try it as we had tried others around Europe.  We didn’t book and was allowed a walk in entry and the atmosphere was great and place was buzzing.  Our server Shane was brilliant and really pleasant  The portion of our burgers was big and generous.  You get asked on how you want your burger done as rare medium well done  The desert portions are massive and taste awesome.  I always wanted to eat here when visiting NY so wasn’t disappointed  Each experience will differ on what your expectations are.  Enjoy the experience as lots of memorabilia to see
40,"Myself and my daughter had prebooked for our first night in nyc, luckily we did as its a very busy place We we seated when we arrived, food and drinks were very good as you would expect from any Hard Rock cafe Stopped in the rock shop on the way out and purchased a pin. Would definitely recommend here to anyone visiting nyc, but prebook."
10,"We booked at the HRC New York for a family evening out. Only three of the four meals ordered arrived, of which one was served cold!. We finished up with one of the family not getting their meal before the others had finished. All in all a total spoilt evening"
30,"Visited February 12th 2023. When we got to the hostess table we waited five minutes while the two staff members working the area finished up the conversation they were having about the Super Bowl. Wasn't until a person who seemed to be a supervisor arrived on the scene that they stopped chatting and offered to help us. Was told there was a 30 minute wait for a table, we accepted this and stood in the wait area. A waitress walking passed asked if we were waiting for a table and told us to follow her into the restaurant. It was empty save for approx 4 tables who had guests at them, so what the 30 minute wait time was about, I'm not sure. Our waitress was super friendly and great at her job. She was happy to offer recommendations for food and suggestions for drinks. Food was hot, tasty and plentiful and not too overly priced considering the location. Desserts were fabulous and HUGE, suggest getting one to share. Would recommend trying Hard Rock Cafe NYC for the experience, would I go back? Probably not. The staff working the hostess desk let it down."
50,Had a fantastic afternoon. Food was great Staff were fab. D j and waitress attentive and helpful. My friend and I booked the bottomless brunch and upgraded to cocktails. Couldn’t have been better! Well done hrc!
40,"So from the outside it looked okay. Inside was detailed with some lovely memorabilia from artists present and past.  Our waiter was pleasant enough, but when it came to paying he seemed disheartened with our tip. We gave him 20% of the bill, but as soon as he checked it he no longer engaged with us. I found this disgustingly rude, we're all not Hollywood A listers that can throw money around. We're simply tourists but from a hard working background. Some of these waiters need to understand we also have mortgages and bills to pay back home aswell.  Onto the food, personally I found the pricing very fair. We paid around $60 for 2 meals and drinks, this also included the Hurricane souvenir glass. All in all a pleasant experience, bar the service at the end. Just stick to what you can afford to tip."
50,"Had a fantastic time in Hard Rock New York, fantastic food, friendly staff, Great Location, everything you need in a Hard Rock Cafe, Thanks New York 😊"
30,"Service was okay as was the atmosphere. Not as busy as expected considering how famous the brand is. Standard menu as in every other Hard Rock Cafe around the world. Good tasting drinks and nice food so can’t complain there. We got the cocktails with the option for the souvenir glasses so we could take new ones home from the shop and when we took the receipt to the shop till with examples of the glasses we wanted (the style we drank from), the staff said they needed to go and get them in the boxes. We trusted they were the correct ones and when we got back we noticed they were not the ones we had chosen/had our drinks from so was a little disappointed."
50,"Excellent food and drinks, big portions, friendly and profesional staff, better make reservation of table day before."
40,"I always enjoy visiting the Hard Rock Cafes of the places I visit, so the NYC one was no exception. I loved the decorations and the memorabilia was really cool to see. The store had an incredible vibe and aesthetic."
50,Always a good meal at hard rock. Our waitress was very helpful and polite. Cater well for for gluten free. Good choice of cocktails.
40,Like the restaurant. The burgers are delicious. But for the price you pay they are cheap with the fries. Like the decorations and music. The store is a plus. Our waitress very friendly.
40,"Coming from the UK and knowing how popular this chain is I pre-booked our table well in advance of our visit to NYC. Last time we came to the city we were unable to get a walk-in that suited so didn't want to face the same disfortune this time round.  We attended on a Wednesday night in early December and after a small que awaiting a photo being taken we got seated. Admittedly our table didn't feel in the best location within the restaurant but despite this we had no issues with it.  Our server was friendly and welcoming. Orders were taken swiftly and drinks and food followed accordingly. I had a burger, followed by an apple cobbler dessert and washed down with a Hurricane cocktail. All were delicious and filled the gap. We opted to pay extra to keep our cocktail glasses and were given receipts to collect fresh ones from the till upstairs on our departure. There we were given options as to whether we wanted standard or commemorative glasses.  I love the Hard Rock chain and love to visit those I get the opportunity to across the world. New York didn't disappoint and I would return in the future."
10,"I ordered the Original Burger with Fries to takeout. The entire experience from the time I walked in was not good. The person at the front directed me to the bar to take my order which was far away from the entrance. At the bar, no one wanted to, or was available to take my order. When I approached two different staff members, it seemed like the excuse was it wasn't their job and to go to the next person.  When I finally found someone willing to take my order, they told me it was going to be a 20 minute wait. I waited patiently. After 25 mins there was no update and so I approached the person who took my order. It turns out he forgot about it and he went to the kitchen to get it as they don't take out your order from the kitchen unless a staff member goes out the back to retrieve it.  I walked back to my hotel which was only 5 mins away. I opened my bag to find soggy cold chips and even worse, a burger which had all the fillings but no sauce. It was a totally dry burger. This was an awful experience. Unattentive staff who couldn't care less and forgot about my order making me wait more than 25 mins for a simple and absolutely atrocious burger, and the whole meal was equally atrocious because it was cold, soggy with a sauceless burger.  Needless to say it was a terrible meal. I'll never go back again and I do not recommend the entire Hard Rock Cafe chain anywhere in the world. I went to the one in Florence in April and although it was OK the fries were no good either and the burger was average at best but at least it had sauce."
50,"Was in NYC 10 days ago and during my short 5 days stay, went twice, the day I arrived and the day I was leaving! Totally worth it, not long wait, good service, great food, good price-quality relation, totally nice decor, as all HR Cafes, this one has an strategic location, right at Times Square, in the middle of the best, in my opinion, Manhattan touristic spot. I need to make a special mention to the server we got on our lunch on 24th, at about 11.45am, don't know her name but we were 2, sitting from the door to the right, not far from the tall tables like bar ones, we got a Messi Burger, the Spicy shrimps and a Salmon and noodle bowl, and the server we got was just AMAZING, I am so sorry did not catch her name, I really hope you could find out, because she was extraordinary kind, nice, super smiley, super knowledgeable of everything, attentive, fast, empathic, everything a great server should have, she had it!!! Always coming back to HRC every time I am in NCY, see you next time! Thanks for keeping the great job!!!"
40,"Could not fault the service or food. It was so nice we just didn’t want it to end. My only criticism was the prices on the menu did not match the receipt, for example a Bud Light was 7.50 but were then charged 8.50 each. Also not happy having to pay 12.99 for the first pint so I could have a glass that I didn’t really want."
10,"15 minutes to be approached to place an order (should have left then).  Nachos took forever to arrive, and our waitress advised part way through starter they were out of the wine we'd ordered. Order an alternative, and then the original wine arrives way after our starter.  Order fajitas...wait ages... server then says they are out of steak and shrimp so we have chicken only.... wait again... supervisor checks if we need anything... advise we are still waiting on our mains. They eventually arrive, supervisor says oh you need cutlery....we wait...10 minutes for cutlery so we can eat...  Friendly but overstretched waitress."
50,Right on Times Square. Great staff. Huge meals. Good music. Souvenirs a bit expensive. Best to book ahead to avoid queues.
40,We made a last minute reservation for dinner online. When we arrived the person on the desk told us it was almost a 1.5 hour wait for walk ups. I told her we had a reservation and were seated straight away so definitely make a reservation. Food was really nice and the server was great. I would eat here again.
30,Usual Hard Rock Cafe set up. Shop and bar restaurant very busy. Usual range of merchandise. Bar service not good as we were scowled at when we just wanted a beer and no food. Offhand and unfriendly.
10,"It has been some time since I last stopped by and I wished it stayed that way. Had to wait like 30 mins to be seated in a practically empty place. Waiter took forever and the drinks and food as well. Food was overcooked, dry, and almost uneatable to the point I left more than half of it. How can you get a burger wrong? Staff seemed unprofessional at best. This has become a tourist rip off and they don't even put up an effort as they just rip you off. NYC has so much more to offer. Go elsewhere."
40,"My wife and I always stop into a Hard Rock to add to the pin collection. No different for NY, NY. Kudos to the staff who were all very friendly and inquisitive where we were from and how we were enjoying the city."
10,"We popped in for dessert. We ordered the brownie sundae, coffee and a shake. The shake was watery. Coffee too. The brownie was flavorless.  And the waiter was useless.  He brought our water ten minutes after our food and it took him 15 minutes to bring the check.  Just a bad experience."
50,"As always, Hard Rock Cafe is wonderful place - food, music and atmosphere. Staff were very nice and food very good . Don’t miss it."
10,"Would give zero stars if I could.  We decided to give it a try after seeing a lot of good reviews and the convenient Times Square location.  Upon arrival, we were told it would be a 30 minute wait and was advised to sit in the bar. We didn’t mind as we expected it to be busy.  We ordered a cocktail and a beer but both were barely drinkable. The cocktail tasted like mouthwash and the beer was so flat.  When our buzzer went and we were sat at our table, we noticed the restaurant was practically empty. We had clearly been sent to the bar to spend more money.  Our meals were so dry, bland and the portion sizes were small considering the price. Worst meal I had in New York. In fact, worst meal I have had all year.  Learn from our mistake and spend your money else where, in one of the many smaller chains/ independent restaurants in NYC."
50,"What a great place for a quick bite and a beer right in the heart of Times Square. Great to wander around and look at Rock items on display. Great service at Bar, by younger and older guy. I had an awesome burger with fries, my partner had the best steak fajitas, she had ever tasted. I had 4 beers and my partner had 2, and a JD N Coke, for a dollar less than 100. This is awesome for Times Square, given what you pay in some of the overpriced eateries in area. Great music too. Great atmosphere in iconic venue. Not sure what some reviewers expect. You won't get fine dining or fancy waitressing, but if you want a fun NY night, this is the place"
40,Book in advance via Open table otherwise you’ll be waiting in a long queue. Usual huge portions. It was my daughters birthday so she was sang to and given a ice cream sundae.
50,"A place for very good cocktails and nice finger foods. This time I had cocktails and chicken wings and it was great, as usual. It was quick and friendly service in a cosy atmosphere with soft, rock music, in a pleasant sound level. Great!"
50,"Based on reviews you would avoid but we had a great meal, so good we ate there again before we left NYC! My daughter is GF and that menu was excellent, she really enjoyed her GF burger with a great bun! I had rob and pulled pork combo which was very good and my son loved the onion ring stack. We booked a table at the door and within 20 mins as stated had a text that the table was ready. On second walk in visit, we hit a table without a wait. Service was excellent so no issues there either and I enjoyed the beer!!"
50,"At first I was disappointed by the man who seated us assuming I was pregnant which I am not!! But our experience was made amazing by Carlos, he was energetic, helpful and all around an amazing guy he made me and my boyfriend very very happy!! The food also was amazing, the best burger I have ever tasted and the cocktails were amazing too. After the rubbish start me and my boyfriend had the BEST night at Hard Rock, would recommend to anyone!!"
10,"Had an ok meal here. Paid and added a tip via the QR code, checked it had been credited then left. Waiter followed us out with another lady and told us we’d “ left something on the table”. I checked I had my phone and purse on me, then realised he was accusing me of not paying. I went back and spoke to the desk who in fairness were apologetic, but being accused of leaving without paying spoilt the evening."
10,"We booked the Hard Rock for our final night in New York and were really looking forward to it. Unfortunately the front desk staff were rude and abrupt with very poor cusyomer service (so much so that we nearly left at this point). Once inside our waitress was OK but still not particularly interested. My steak was meant to be medium/well done and my husbands medium rare, both looked the same and were very well done. Overall a disappointing experience"
10,"I’ve been to many Hard Rock restaurants and wrongfully assumed New York would have the coolest one. Don’t make the same mistake we did. Our burgers were raw, tasteless, and the ambiance was a let down. There are so many great restaurants in NYC. Skip this one. You’re welcome"
50,"There were a lot of people in line, but the wait goes quickly. The gift shop has lots of fun things to see, too. Our meal was delicious, and our service was very good!"
50,"Our table waitress was outstanding, her name was Racquel and was so enthusiastic and interested in our trip from the UK. She couldn’t have done more for us. Would happily recommend this restaurant- and look forward to returning."
10,"The worst service, mediocre food. Will never go back and recommend you avoid this place! So many more options available to you! On arrival, we were seated at the bar. Looking at menu to order a drink, the waiter visibly was annoyed and said he’d be back and walked away. Ten mins later he came back to take our drink order. I asked for water as well. We got our beers, but no water. I asked him again if we could have some water. No water came. Got our food after a long wait. Food was mediocre, but edible. Asked again for water, water never came. The wait staff who brought our drinks walked past several times, but never asked if we wanted another beer. I dropped my fork, a staff member saw and said he’s bring me a new one. New fork never came! Eventually, the wait staff looked over and gave me the thumbs up, to which I called out ‘I’ll have the bill, please’. First time I’ve never left a tip. If I had 2 pennies, that is what I would have left the gent who was supposed to be looking after us. Atrocious service, warm beer, average food. Never again."
30,Usually love a Hard Rock but the food was disappointing. Our waitress took our order and that was the last we saw of her until it came time for the check. Way too many other places to eat in NYC
30,"Another USA city, another @hardrocknewyork  I’m still not a fan of these places but it was the only place nearby for a refreshing drink in the 90 degree heat.  The queue to eat in had a two hour wait, so it was fortunate we only needed a refreshment.  Drinks were good and reasonable prices but heck, I must be getting old because the music was so loud, we couldn’t hear each other speak, nor could the waiter hear us without getting very close (Covid alert!!)  We were in and out within a hour.  Hard Rock is always consistent and clearly popular. The retail store was full with tourists with cash registers cachinging continually.  If nothing else, check out the memorabilia on display in the cafe."
40,"We were pleasantly surprised at our lunch-time visit. We were ready for the rock ‘n roll hoopla – the guitars on display, the loud music etc. – but we found the burgers – extra large – very tasty. Obviously not a “fine dinning” restaurant, but an excellent “hamburger joint.”"
10,Never go here because the food is overpriced and sub-par at best. The service is awful. They were so slow that we had to wait 15 minutes to get the bill and then when we got it no one came near us for so long that we had to get up and give the payment to a server working on the til. Then we went upstairs to the gift shop and one of the servers followed us and told one of us to come with him. He was adimant that he only wanted one (for intimidation purposes). We said all three of us would go downstairs as we hadn't done anything wrong. When we went downstairs they were suspicious of us that we hadn't paid and insinuated that we would have to pay again. We said we had definitely paid and that they could check CCTV and for some reason they wouldn't?!! They wouldn't let us leave and then found out that it was in fact one of their staff and gave out to us telling us that we should give it to someone behind the bar. That wasn't our faults as we were waiting so long we just wanted to pay and leave. They really treated us like criminals and people were looking at us. It was truly humiliating! I wish I could give it 0 stars but unfortunately 1 will have to do.
10,"Booked as a treat for my sons 13th birthday after travelling to NYC from Liverpool UK.  The experience was all round extremely poor, after eating in so many other places around the city on this trip and also having visited other Hard Rock venues over the years (Barcelona only last month).  The food was really poor, the service was atrocious with the young guy serving us literally throwing the meals at us and very inattentive/unhelpful when requesting the very basics (mayonnaise etc) and you could tell he would rather be somewhere else.  I also told the reception the day before when reserving the table it was for my sons 13th birthday, so they could hopefully make something of that as in a happy birthday etc (nothing).  I settled my bill at the table and mentioned in passing at the reception ( where the manager was) what a poor show/disappointment and would also advise friend and family to give the venue a big wide berth.  I feel this branch/arm of the chain is trading on its brand name and would not be returning there in a hurry it was that poor.  Gary Jones Liverpool UK"
10,"Our meal was great, the food was delicious and the staff were friendly and kind. However, the live music was horrendous. It was extremely loud which meant we could not have a conversation, and the song choice was pretty poor as well. All they played was obscure Disney songs from films like Tangled and Hercules. Overall quite a poor experience, would not go back again."
20,"First trip to New York and this is the worst hard rock I have ever been to. The food was cold. After long discussion managed to get a partial refund, but it wasn't easy. Won't be going again or recommending it to others. What a shame..."
30,"Very mediocre food, we got stuck with here as we didn’t book and there was a post theatre rush - would maybe just pop in for drinks if you’re wanting to look at memorabilia"
10,Group reservation - pre-ordered entrees - 1 he 15 to get food. No manager - waitstaff rude laughed at us when we asked for help. Good disgusting and overpriced. Do NOT spend your money there!!!
30,"The service was disappointing here. We did have a really large tour group, but when a mistake with our reservation was presented, they were extremely difficult to work with. And this tour group was children…..cmon. Food is fine. Atmosphere is ok. There are so many other places to go to in times square. SO many. Please go somewhere else."
50,"I am not the biggest fan of the Hard Rock Cafe chain, but wanted to stop here in New York. Service was friendly, quick, prices are ok and I think we had here the best burger we tried in NY :))"
50,"We, as Hard rock café fans, stop always if one is in town. Great, tasty burger. Try the “Impossible burger” with beyond meat. You won't notice the difference (to real meat). Thanks to the waiter Martino for the suggestions. For dessert we shared the brownies (party of three), because it’s big."
30,"Visited before seeing a show on Broadway. We had booked a table and were shown straight through. We then sat at our table for over 15 minutes before we were able to call someone over and order a drink. We had over 5 different servers, 2 telling us different things about a drink I wanted and none of them had an ounce of enthusiasm between them and were verging on rude, which we found strange as the service we have been provided since arriving in New York everywhere’s has been brilliant. I will say the food was delicious as was the purple haze cocktail I had, so worth a visit to see the memorabilia and decent food, just don’t expect service with a smile!"
10,"Unfriendly service, soulless - no atmosphere whatsoever. Messi burger looks great on the marketing material, in reality a Big Mac would be better! I should say that we are Hard Rock fans & have visited HR cafes in Spain, Egypt, all cafes in the UK, Vegas, Florida & finally New York. We have also stayed in Hard Rock Hotels in London & Tenerife in the last year (post Covid). Fast falling out of love with what was a fantastic brand, service & product."
50,"We went to Hard Rock Cafe last night for dinner, we didn’t book but on arrival they told us it would be a 35 mins wait which was expected and texted us when our table was ready, was less that 35 mins, the inside of this hard rock is an old cinema style - very nice! Good music and atmosphere and decent enough food, we have the nachos to share for start…. They were huge and amazing! and a burger for main, I’ve had better burgers but was nice overall, we had Luke I believe as a waiter he was energetic, polite and friendly, overall a good experience, would definitely visit again if in NYC (reasonably priced beers to! $7.50 compared to the $14 a pint we paid in Bubba Gump!!!)"
50,"Great location on Times Square , food good, but you really go there for the atmosphere and iconic music displays"
10,"To be far to be them the service was fast but that’s the only good thing I have to say. From the get go we almost had 30$ added to the bill for a photo we didn’t even want the photoshop looked like something my nan could of done better. The food was awful so overpriced it was horrendous, a McDonald’s burger would of been nicer the burger was dry and bland Now I’ll get on to the waitress, we had Brianna, seemed nice at first or that was our first views on her until she tried to take the plate away from my mother as she was still eating to which my mother had to bat her hand away, they were trying to hurry us up out the restaurant when half the place was empty and I’m not surprised it’s empty with the high prices and terrible food and the waitress’ stealing the plates back away from you. So after not a great meal as we were leaving Brianna then ran after us claiming we had underpaid. She counted it again still 20$ under the bill my girlfriend counted it 16$ Extra on the bill for tip, which we should of taken back for the terrible service from Brianna, she may also need some maths lesson on how to count properly before accusing her customers  Save your money go to McDonald’s or a vendor on the street, the food would be better"
40,"Very happy to have come back to this iconic place on Time Square. We had a nice family dinner on Tuesday 12th April: good and plentiful shareable dishes, friendly staff, vibrant atmosphere and even a decent red wine! Children loved it and after 14 years, for $190 all inc. (5 shareable dishes, 2 soft drinks, 2 desserts, 1 bottle of red wines) and crazy inflation everywhere, I do believe there is much much worse in NYC!! :) I would definitely recommend for anyone visiting NYC."
30,"This place is all hype! But it lived up to it’s name, my burger was rock hard and it almost ruined my night. But then I looked over to the front of the kitchen and my my DeAndre Laquavius III made my rock hard if you know what I mean ."
30,"The Hard Rock Cafe is an iconic restaurant and a must see if you are in New York City. I know it may be frequented by tourists but it really has the perfect location in Time Square near the Theatre District. My visit was for lunch prior to attending a Broadway show. I have been to many Hard Rock Cafes but the Time Square location is one of my favorites. The people are super nice. The atmosphere is trendy. The eats are always good. And the Hurricanes are to die for! (Side note: My main reason for eating here was location AND I wanted a Hurricane!)  One does not eat at a Hard Rock Cafe often so I decided to just go for it when I ordered (No dieting today!). To start, I ordered their famous Hurricane in the souvenir glass. I know what you are thinking...Did she seriously buy the glass?....Yes, I did! :) It was feeling like a burger and fries kind of day so I order the Original Legendary Burger and since I was just going for it, ordered the loaded fries. As an after thought, the fries were probably a bit over the top but they were really good with the melted cheese and pieces of chive and bacon. Well worth my calorie splurge and very yummy.  Before leaving I did stroll around looking at the Rock and Roll memorabilia on the walls and did buy an extra souvenir or two before leaving."
50,"I don’t even know where to start! We visited on March 17th, and it was great. Such a great atmosphere, and the staff are always lovely! This was my third time visiting, and it’s never let me down. Our server Bam was exceptional! It was my birthday, and he made sure everyone knew about it. If I’m ever back in the city, I’ll definitely be back!"
50,"We went for early dinner so it was quiet. Our waiter James was LOVELY. Advised well and helped us chose drinks. Food came out quickly, was hot and tasty! Great experience!"
40,Located very near Times Square. I popped in for an early dinner before it got too busy. I sat at the bar. It took a little while to get noticed but when I did get noticed the barman was very attentive. I order Salman salads and had a couple of beers. The portion was huge and I struggled to eat the whole salad. There is the hard rock shop upstairs
50,"Service was very friendly, ridiculous portions size - full satisfied couldn't even finish our pudding which me and my fiance shared as it was so big. Little bit pricey but definately worth it."
50,"Lots of cool memorabilia! Service was super efficient, food was tasty. A good atmosphere and a really cool building - would return."
50,"We visited Hard Rock a couple of times during our visit, it was great! We loved sitting at the bar, the staff were friendly, helpful & attentive. Definitely try the blackberry sangria cocktail, it was delicious!"
50,"It's always a must, mainly because I collect the pins, but the food is consistently great. We've eaten at HR(s) all over the world. We've tried almost the entire menu. This time I had ribs, awesome. My husband had a burger. It was an hour wait, but if you can find a seat at the bar and we did, you can get full service. Their bar area actually has a separate long marble table top and we sat there. Waiter (wish I remembered his name but I think Joseph) was awesome. It was New Years night in the bar area."
50,"We went to the Hard Rock Cafe on 24th December. As with all other restaurants in New York City, there was a vaccine requirement, which definitely made us feel safer.  We ordered: Original Legendary Burger, and New York Strip Steak.  Despite going on Christmas Eve and the website claiming to be fully booked, there was only a 30 minute wait. We went at 4.30PM but when we left (6.00PM), there was a large queue, so bear that in mind.  The staff were very friendly, as we are accustomed to from other HRC experiences, and the food was as great as always. The tables were socially distanced, which made us feel safe.  Will definitely be coming back if I'm ever in the area."
10,So we visited here last night at 7pm.thurs 30th Dec.told an hour wait then we saw it was empty and questioned it and was shown to a table immediately .the staff on the desk were so rude and no customer service atall....bearing in mind there were family's with young children waiting in the hall and it was half empty tables left un cleaned the whole time we were there tables were left empty and unused and dirty!! Food was awfull .my chicken was like rubber. On leaving she was still telling family's an hour to 2 hour wait.the place was empty!!! The 2 females on the desk were so rude and unfriendly. How they have a job in hospitality is beyond me.stay away!!
10,"I came here today with my family for dinner that, by the way, was quite uncomfortable because unfortunately the waiter spilled a beer on my dad’s new iphone. After we finished dinner, we decided to go to the hard rock’s shop (that is located just at the entrance of the building) to buy some t-shirts and stuff like that. Well, we bought several things but the cashier was really rude to us so my dad asked to talk with the store manager. When the store manager came, he started to talk really loud and acted rude to my dad, even if there were a lot of other costumers watching the scene. His intervention was totally unhelpful and disrespectful. We spent a fair amount between the dinner and the shop so is not cool at all to be treated like that as costumers but, most of all, as persons because they were SO disrespectful I can’t even explain. It is believed by many that this hard rock is a must to visit if you’re a tourist in new york, but the staff who works in there definitely ruins everything!!! Never coming back and if you choose to come at the hard rock in new york be aware of the people you may meet."
20,You don't necessarily go to the Hard Rock for the food but the food here was really only average. The service was OK but nothing special. Still a decent place to eat while visiting Time Square.
10,"Awful experience, no atmosphere, had to send the food back because it was cold, waiter (Jonathan) told us about signing up to get a free desert then when we ordered it was clearly annoyed about it. Finished off with being told to have an “un-happy holidays”!"
20,On arriving we got snapped at for being 10 minutes late . I explained it was my twin daughters birthday but nothing special was done for them . I waited for ages for my cocktail and my daughters main meal came out before the starter. It then all came at once . No atmosphere. Verydisappointing .
10,"We ate here for dinner between two shows because it was the closest ""easy"" place to grab food. We walked in the doors and one of the employees snapped at us that those doors were the exit and to go back outside. There were NO signs or indications that that was the exit at the gift shop. We went in the other doors and the line was out the door because they were holding a special event there. People were keeping the doors open, letting all of the cold air rush in with the high winds. As they tried to check vaccination cards, they were yelling at everyone to crowd in and shut the doors.  We finally made it downstairs to the dark, dive bar style dining room. Our waitress wasn't the most mannered woman, and the food was awful. I got the pulled pork BBQ sandwich, which was a hard bun, dry pork, and a bit of sauce. The fries were the only decent part. It's a typical tourist trap restaurant that isn't worth the time."
40,"Conveniently located in Times Square. So if your being a tourist it is a good spot to eat.  Great memorabilia and overall fun atmosphere. Good food and fast service. Unfortunately, very limited menu.  Not very crowded for lunch on Friday. Last time I was here a decade ago line was out the door.  Need to show ID and vaccination card."
40,"Tried to book online and said there was no tables so we turned up to chance our luck. Got in straight away and it wasn’t busy at all. Food was just like any other hard rock we had been in just went as we knew what to expect. As a whole it’s only been the little New York eating places that have blown us away with their food, the larger companies have just been plain and nothing exciting. Our waitress was lovely. Nothing over the top just a nice girl. Would still like to experience here when it’s lively."
50,"But lots of fun! We've been here before, so knew what to expect. service very good, considering staff shortages everywhere. Hamburgers and onion rings great!."
20,I always stop at a Hard Rock Cafe when we visit bigger cities and always have a great experience. This time it was the opposite. Yes - the place is well decorated and has great memorabilia and the hostess and waitress was great but the food was almost inedible. I had the chicken fingers and they were so overcooked you could not even bite into them! My son and grand-daughter had the wings and my son powered through his but my grand-daughter could barely eat 2 they were so tough. At least the fries were good. I will not be going back.
50,"The Hard Rock Cafe is a wonderful rock and roll theme restaurant that offers guests tantalizing meals and drinks while also playing great America pop hit songs.  In November of 2021, I brought and treated my wife and myself for dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe, and we very much enjoyed our dining experience!!!  When entering Hard Rock Cafe, my wife and I were graciously welcomed by the restaurant’s staff and we were both captivated by the extensive collection of rock and roll memorabilia and portraits of incredible music legends.  Both my wife and I found our meals to be well cooked, well seasoned and superbly delicious.  We’d also to like to acknowledge and thank our waiter, Bam for his amazing professionalism, stellar attention to details and for making sure that both us had a great time at the Hard Rock Cafe.  When traveling through Manhattan, New You, we encourage everyone to visit and dine at Hard Rock Cafe!!! You’ll have a enjoyable dining experience while also listening to sensational pop classics."
50,As any HR you expect to be overwhelmed by the memorabilia throughout. Had a bloody Mary at the bar. Good quick service. Drink wasn't bad t start the day. The music wasn't so loud you couldn't talk. It was just right
50,"Late dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe was great. Nice music, not too crowded, fast and good service, huge portions, tasty food. We ordered Thai spicy shrimps, BBQ ribs, onion rings it was delicious."
50,"Both my friend and I stopped here for dinner on 9/1/21. We were both welcomed by the hostess and brought to our table. Our server was a server in training along with his assistant, both were extremely professional & attentive. We both started off with Hurricanes and a fried onion ring tower, the drinks were wonderful and the onion rings were crispy and so savory along the tantalizing dipping sauces of bbq & ranch. Then for our entrees we both had the bbq pork sandwiches that came with beans, coleslaw & fries, the flavors of it all were spot on deliciousness. I was impressed with my visit as a culinarian & foodie. Hard Rock Cafe is definitely a fun place. Highly Recommended!"
40,"No matter what city we go to we always know that we can get some good food and drink.  We had just arrived in NY and had walked from where we parked our car. It was hot and we were tired and starving. Hard Rock was a shining beacon in Times Square.  Some burgers and drinks and we were ready to go.  I would always recommend Hard Rock. As my review title says, it is definitely Old Faithful!"
40,"My daughter and I enjoyed dinner here for her 21st birthday. We love looking at all the memorabilia in the multiple dining rooms. The food is good, but it’s the atmosphere we enjoy most!"
40,"I went on a school trip with my high school to America. We stayed in New York for a few nights and for the first night we were booked to go to Hard Rock Cafe. After a long day of traveling the sound of having some nice comfort food was amazing. The place was full of people, great music, a good gift shop full of different stuff. Overall it gives off positive vibes which was really nice. We were seated straight away. Server was friendly and made sure orders were taken quickly. Food was fantastic. I would definitely recommend at least visiting Hard Rock Cafe once. I really enjoyed it there but I personally didn’t like how when we were waiting for food an individual went to all tables and took photos of the customers as it was apart of their job but I would’ve just preferred it if that didn’t happen but apart from that it was a really good experience."
40,We ate at the bar after a show. Nachos and salad with a couple of glasses of wine. Just the right stuff at the right time in a energetic atmosphere. Thank you Duane!
40,"We didn't book, but only had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table, enough time to check out the memorabilia - the wall of guitars was amazing. The shop upon entry is filled with all things Hard Rock -so fill your boots!! Once we were called through to the restaurant we were seated and served by Kayla, who was really friendly and helpful. We ordered far too much - but all of it was delicious and we got take out boxes with the remaining food - there was lots. The music, and atmosphere was great, music not too loud so you could hold a conversation - it was really busy - which only proves to state how good it is. Good location off Times Square too."
30,"I went a Lot of times to the Hard Rock and the Last years changed to bad. I prefer other places to go, not so big, different. I hate to go to dinner or lunch to a empty place and must to wait a Lot to be seat where a Guy or a Womans wants ... And other Situations. Specially the Times Square Hard Rock I don't like it!!! Sorry! And the Food!!! My Gosh!"
50,"It may sound noisy initially but if you find a good place at the bar, the noises fade away and you can enjoy the company of your partner. One of the best Hard Rock Cafes one finds anywhere in the world."
50,"We went here twice on our four day trip to NYC as we really enjoyed the food and atmosphere the first time. It’s reasonably priced for the location and the food is tasty and fresh, and the staff are fantastic. Nice to be able to look at all the memorabilia too."
40,"I had a very good burger here. The atmosphere is unique but do not expect hard rock music, there were more rap and pop video clips than rock."
50,"Such a cool place to visit, we came here for breakfast and for dinner it was so nice, lots to look at too in the museum, pictures of famous musicians, guitars and costumes they wear. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be visiting again next time we are in New York."
50,"Came here twice, once for drinks and snacks during the day and an evening meal whit a hell of a lot of drinks. Staff are fun and happy, drinks are good, once you’ve got your souvenir pint glass, just ask for a 16 oz drink, half the price. Food is great. It’s expensive but your in Times Square!"
10,"This is Hard Rock Cafe no.3 on my list, I make an effort to visit as many as possible on my trips to try the local legendary burger + buy the local T shirt  The joke of it is during our visit they was a DJ pounding club music and also pop music, not a single rock song. If you call pitbull, Rihanna, Katy Perry and so on rock music then you may like it. Music was so loud it was like sitting in revolutions or oceana for a sit down meal  I asked what the local legendary burger was as for whatever reason they had printed the default menu which says ""the local legendary burger is different and unique to each hard Rock Cafe"" the menu should have a description of their own speciality burger.  The lady replied pointing at a picture ""it's like that one with a bit of apple in it and some jam"" I decided to have it anyway but unfortunately she's only gone and brought me the bog standard legend burger. I wasn't going to wait another 20 minutes so just put up with it  The experience was ruined from the loud club mixes they kept playing and we couldn't hear ourselves speak. Food quality was laughable compared to any other hard Rock Cafe. (cheese on burger was pre melted but left for a while before it got to me so was almost hardened, pub food standard at best)  Honestly since looking at trip advisor it's got the same kind of reviews since 2015 so nothing is changing. Take my warning and avoid, or if you collect the t shirts like me just use the rock shop and dash out for an arbys instead. At least the food will be good and you can stick your earphones in for the AC-DC"
10,Rude hostesses tipped me off that this wasn't going to be a good experience. As a Rewards member I expected some respect. I have been to over 150 cafes worldwide over 30 years and have never been so disappointed. The place if full of teenage tour groups who even drown out the loud music. The cafe at Yankee Stadium is cooler by far.
40,Visited here for food and drinks and it’s a must visit. I’m never been to a Hard Rock Cafe as an adult and it was an experience. We hadn’t booked but we’re offered a table at the bar which was fine. We each had a burger and it was delicious... expensive but nice! Also this was the only place that we visited in New York that did not automatically add a service charge.  The only reason this wasn’t excellent was because the service wasn’t great and we had to ask for the table to be cleaned and cutlery a few times! It was extremely busy though and the staff were running around.  Def worth a visit alone for the shop/ lobby
50,We visited here for lunch on our last day in NYC. We wanted to stay away from chains but this was honestly one of the best meals we had all trip! Plus our waitress was amazing.  We got a large nachos to start 2 cocktails and 2 mains and it was around 90 dollars however we didn’t mind. We were made to feel extremely comfortable and so glad we visited before we flew home! With 2 free glasses also.
10,"We pre-booked a table for 2 for our trip last weekend way back in December to ensure we could get in. Upon arrival at the restaurant, even though we had prebooked, we were told that there would still be a good hour of waiting time?! I then asked the server if we could at least get a drink from the bar, were i was told yes. Upon arriving at the bar and before my bum could even reach the seat of my chair, I was told rather rudely "" he cant sit here, he is under 21"".  I can understand this, however, given he is 18 and looks older than he does, i would of appreciated for the bar lady to atleast ask if he had Id or at least politely said he is to young to sit at the bar (we only wanted to sit down for a short while to order a drink whilst we were preparing to wait for our table)  After being spoken to like that, we didn't want to wait an hour for our table so just left.  Defo wont be coming back if i visit the city!"
30,"We pre arranged breakfast for 100 people and they opened at 7am for us. Normal opening time is 8am. Standard USA breakfast, nothing special but was good enough for us before a long day in New York."
30,"We’ve recently gone to this Hard Rock for a family lunch on our holiday. We’ve had nachos and guacamole for starters and it was delicious. Then we tried the famous burger and the one with fried onions and they were really nice. We’ve also had 2 salmons at our table and they were slightly too fatty, but really tasty and filling. Chips as sides were nice too. A bit too expensive, but i guess it’s because of the name and the location on Times Square."
40,"We went on Thursday, which unknown to us had the DJ in, what a great night we had, made us want to stay longer, but we were all tired. Food was spot on, expect to pay a little more, for one you are eating at Hard Rock and two, you are bang in the Central of Times square, but all in all, didn't exceed what a British meal out would cost. If I was to be critical at all, our waitress didn't really describe the dessert menu, when we really wanted a dessert, but they looked limited and boring, but on leaving we saw families eating big sharer desserts which we would of purchased. On reflection Ive been to the Orlando Hard Rock a few times, this is better!"
50,"Nice Decor! Share a platter: crumbed chicken, spring rolls, rosti's, chicken wings, brochetta's, onion rings. Great music, visit the shop."
50,"We enjoyed a great meal here, our server was particularly attentive and helpful when we asked for gluten free options. We were glad we'd pre-booked online as it was very busy. Service was quite quick considering just how busy it was and the food was very enjoyable, my husband really enjoyed his gluten free burger."
40,Pleasantly surprised with this restaurant - the food was good and prompt. Part way through our meal our waiter announced he was about to go on his break and introduced us to another member of staff should we need any thing in his absence. Great atmosphere and the music was not loud meaning we could still talk to each other
30,Was seated at the bar on a busy Friday night. Had a signature burger great quality food. Consistency of Hard Rock food globally is commendable. However might be a New York thing but service exceptionally poor staff was very rude and unhelpful. Waiters take tips for granted.
30,"Let me first say the staff was friendly. Our waitress was rather busy, but tried to be as attentive as possible. I’m giving it 3 stars because the breakfast buffet was a bit overpriced for the minimum amount of food on display. There were tons of pastries, but only one hot item that would be considered vegetarian. By hot, I mean in the warming trays, but extremely cold. The pancakes that were brought out were very tasty and the complimentary mimosa was alright. It was just enough to wet my throat. I was shocked at the large glass and significantly small amount that was in the glass. The coffee was my least favorite part. I love coffee, but this was too thick.  The decor was like other Hard Rocks, pleasing to the eye. The music being played was appropriate.  I’m not sure I would ever go back to this location, but it was an experience nonetheless."
50,"Wife,son and I called in and were seated very quickly,wife and son had the steak and I had the baby back ribs,which I have to say was first class,would like to add service was also first class,the only gripe I would have is that food was a bit over priced but over all a great night had by all at HRC"
30,"The Hardrock Cafe in Time Square is everything you SHOUDL expect... super busy, super expensive and of a very 'okay' quality. But as an experience it's pretty good. So the food was okay (but for $38 for a steak I'd want MUCH more), the drinks were okay but at least the service was superb! Worth it for the experience but much better places to eat!"
40,"Usual standard of food, good. Good tip, on arrival we were told it would be an hour and 45 min wait but opted to do so as it was our first night and we’d had a long journey. Wandered through to bar area to find loads of tables, families etc and discovered could have whole menu choice with no wait at all. Delighted"
20,2 visits.  Everything is geared to get you to buy stuff in the shop.  The food is extremely generic and served with 0 passion and customer interest.  Going in for breakfast we got a price going in and another price when the bill came. 40% higher price.  Stay away.
10,the choice for Vegetarians is so small I must have missed it . Dated place still in 1970 . Toilets dirty just paid for drinks as we had to wait for 25 mins even though we had a reservation for 5 people would not recommend in my opinion.
50,"After getting married in florida and having our reception at hard rock we've made it our mission to make sure we visit everyone in cities we visit in the future.  To the lady supervisor, our sever lenny who were working on the 17th February 8am onwards thank you so much for an excellent visit. We had our bill taken care of and honestly it took us back, things like that never happen to us and it was an amazing way to end our honeymoon in the big apple! Also to the lady (of colour with abit of a walking inpediment.. Sorry i completely forgot your name and cant describe you any other way) you are a credit to your company! Huge smile, welcoming and made us feel so at ease you also made such a fuss of our son Charlie which not everybody does. Thank you so much for a great welcome and shopping experience!  Breakfast buffet was great, the selection was plentyful and great value for money! Its definitely worth a visit if your around times square!"
50,"We went there during dinner time and is bit hard to get a good place since we are 6 adults. After waited for about 10 min, we got a small table ti seat and order our meal. The ribs and steak were good and not forgetting the onion rings as well! We enjoyed our dinner there"
30,"Popped in during lunch time to grab a few drinks. Not too much offered on the lunch menu so we decided to just grab an appetizer. Went with the lobster flatbread, it was OK. Of course the drinks are a little pricey, but at least you can get a souvenir glass if you want to tote it around. I was happy to see plenty of bartenders and they were just attentive enough that we didn't feel neglected nor harassed. Definitely made our trek through Times Square more bearable. Very cool and very big place."
50,"We arrived at 6:00 PM and although the place was packed, we were seated almost immediately. The menu in all HRCs is pretty much staple so I won’t go into that, but the atmosphere and the service was GREAT. Kudos to Amanda our waiter who did not miss a beat over multiple tables, and made this a memorable visit."
10,Travelled 4000 miles to spend valentines in New York we selected the Hard Rock in times square as our valentines meal totally ruined by poor food served cold and absolutely appalling customer service.  Spoke to the manager who didn't care over our ruined valentine's meal offered us a refund for the food we never ate which was the least he could do.  A special trip ruined a trip we will never get back.
50,"We always visit HRCs and this visit was great as usual. Food, drinks and service is always spot on in Hard Rocks. Couldn’t fault anything, we had the mac and cheese and a steak - both cooked perfectly. Highly highly recommend the chicken flatbread to start, amazing!! Thanks guys!"
50,This is a great hard rock I've never been to a bad 1 in any country but this is 1 of my favourites so far great surroundings and the staff are brilliant
30,Ribs arrived cold. Returned to us when heated up rather than getting a fresh order. Waitress was very helpful though
50,"HARD ROCK CAFE, great meal here and great entertainment. The waiters are really nice and the food is great. We had some potato skins that wasn’t on the menu that the waiter managed to sort for us as it was on the sharing platter. Really good vibe with DJ playing music get a picture as you walk in also. Check it out."
40,"Visited with my family of 5. Allocated a small table . Drinks and food ordered which was ok. Paid the $145 bill on a pre loaded card. Left $10 tip. Went to leave via the toilet , on leaving the toilet the waiter was there asking me to sign a receipt! Don’t see why as I paid. He was probably upset that I hadn’t tipped the recommended 20% not a chance he was lucky to get 10% so another overpriced restaurant where the staff expect good tips for doing very little."
30,First time i was here at the location and i felt this hrc miss its soul. Yes it is big compared the old one and thats all. No service here compared hrc yankee station
10,"I had high expectations of this place and booked a table for our last meal in NYC. The staff were lovely and attentive, the girls on the main desk were great and the guy looking after our table was nice however I did notice he took the time to charm to the the table behind us a lot more ... probably because there was 6 of them and only 2 of us. My son had the chicken tenderloins and he ate 2 of them saying they tasted old, they were like warm when they came. I had the chicken fajitas, the onions and peppers on the sizzler were rock hard and cold and it certainly didn’t come out sizzling, it’s like they had been left in the kitchen for 20 mins before they were brought out. It all looked appetising but the taste didn’t match."
20,Firstly I had to wait for A table that I had booked...  Secondly it took 30 minutes for our drinks to come and the excuse we got was they were doing a kitchen handover  My girlfriend burger come out wrong  The host was rude to guest waiting to get in  Hard Rock Cafe is something to say you've done it but nothing more. My girlfriend was really looking forward to going but ended up disappointed  Few more days in New York I will something better
30,"Always wanted to try a Hard Rock Cafe, I don’t know if they’re all the same. The food here was overpriced and pretty average, it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great. I could have gotten better food elsewhere for cheaper. The server was a little obnoxious and didn’t seem to care too much. Waiting ages to pay, so tipped only 10% and got glared at by the server. There was hardly anybody in, the was no reason for us to be there for over an hour and a half, she’s lucky she got 10%."
20,"We went on Superbowl 2020 Night, expecting a relaxing and funny Night. But ir was the opposite. The waiter was not paying attention to anyone, the food took to long and when it came there wasn't forks and knives to eat, the beverages took to long also. So it was very frustrating to us."
10,Terrible customer service by Hard Rock cafe who took a table booking for tonight and then subsequently cancelled the table via e-mail after we had set off for the restaurant for no tangible reason. When we arrived we were informed bookings need to be made 24 hours prior to eating which is clearly not correct because the site offered a table time and accepted our booking. Disgraceful performance by a company we will not be using again and I would advise others to do the same.
30,"The only reason to visit is the cool rock memorabilia and to say you’ve been. Now we did visit at lunchtime so the vibe will always be lower key, but considering we were surrounded by all this amazing rock history and music playing there was little in the way of ambience. Servers were following the script and pleasant but like robots, no energy, no enthusiasm. A big thumbs up for the nacho starter which is definitely to share but I did burn my mouth as plates were overheated and even a nacho on the peripheral of the plate was scalding. Mains were mediocre, not much by way of flavour, we skipped dessert. Not worth a hundred bucks for lunch."
40,Avoid the queues just ask to sit at the bar and enjoy the same food n experience! The cocktails are poorly done - give them a miss n stick to beers/ wines/ straight from the bottle! Ordered the ribs - awesome and finished with cheesecake which was delicious. Bar service was good!
40,"We booked online beforehand as I went a few years ago and there was quite a wait for walk ins. Food was nice, nothing to boast about but yummy. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. Reasonably priced. Would go again."
20,"When we arrived I advised the Hostess we had a booking although I could see it was very empty.....she said they didn't take bookings (however I had the confirmation on my phone) no apology offered. shown to the buffet breakfast area which was dimly lit but then think they are all like this part of the character. The food was ok nothing to get excited about. Probably going for breakfast not the best choice and we wouldn't rush back service was poor food not great, ambience non existent and staff couldn't care less if the had our business or not......mind you still looking for the tips!"
40,"Decent food, not the best, but was nice none the less. Its quite pricey but you'd expect nothing less from New York time square. To be honest, I really enjoyed this place though, its a great atmosphere and lots of random music videos playing on the big screen with no pattern was fantastic, If you're in New York , you have to give this place a go, I would suggest you on their website and book a table though as otherwise you'll be waiting on the stairs for a little while. Good fun place."
40,"This was a perfect fun dinner in between our showings of HP and the Cursed Child. It is a fun, musical place with lots of cool music paraphernalia. The food is as expected - hamburgers were delicious, fajitas were good. Nothing gourmet but that was not why we went! Friendly service, we were seated at our reservation time. Service was smooth!"
10,"Having eaten in the London Hard Rock Cafe I was keen to try out New Yorks. We entered the shop and at the bottom of some stairs was a desk in which we assumed we had to go to and wait to be seated. There was a family in front who were seen to straight away yet we were left just standing there. No greeting, nothing. One waiter was genuinely doing everything he could to avoid making eye contact with us.  The waitress behind the desk didn’t greet us either, and we were left stood there wondering if we were in the right place. It got to the point where people were going in front of us in the queue also met with the same bad attitude.  Eventually after being stood at this desk for around 5 minutes I was offered a table but with an hours wait. I asked the waitress if it was okay if we waited in the bar, to which she handed me a console with no explanation of where to go etc. She literally handed us this console without saying a word.  We walked into the main dining area (assuming the bar was in here) and walked up to the bar to find that there was infact people eating there. The whole cafe in itself was not full so unsure as to why the wait was so long unless it was fully booked. We walked around the whole cafe but came to the decision we would leave as we did not feel welcomed at all.  As we left I handed the console back to the worker who took it without a word and as we were leaving the manager was shouting at us ‘well how long have you been waiting?!’ Truly one of the most miserable places I have ever been in and somewhat ruined our evening. Will never return to it."
30,"My partner is a ‘Hard Rock’ fan, but I don’t know what all the fuss is about. This is a really large restaurant and we had to wait up to 45mins for a table, but when we walked through the restaurant it wasn’t full by any means. Usual food on offer and service as you would expect"
40,"Not dissapionted at all. It does what it says. Very nice food, drinks & service. We were very well looked after by our server & this is what we have grown to expect from Hard Rock."
40,"We all had the Legendary Burger and it was delicious. Service was friendly and very good. Seating comfortable. Big place but we didn't feel closed in. Novel experience and priced well and according to our grandson, best burger sauce ever!"
50,"My family and wanted to have dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and the wait time was almost and hour but we waited and guess what, we didn't have to wait but maybe 20 minutes. The staff was great, the food was very delicious and timely. The videos were entertaining."
10,"I have literally just left the Hard Rock Cafe in New York and I am disgusted with the attitude of the waiter who served us tonight. We waited well over an hour for our food and although we enjoyed the food served, I felt that it was a long time to wait - the waiter apologised twice during our wait for the delay but several tables around us received their food before us and had sat down after us? The food bill came to $197 and I left $220 ($23 gratuity) even though the check suggested that I leave between $32 and $35 as a tip. On leaving the restaurant I went to the restroom and as I came out to go up over the stairs to leave I noticed our waiter stood there, he was waiting to speak to me about the amount I had left as gratuity - I told him that his service was OK but the wait for food was too long. I did not appreciate being stopped in front of several other customers and asked my reasons for not leaving what the restaurant thinks I should leave as a tip. I work in Customer Service and appreciate any 'tip' my customers wish to give but I certainly do not expect it and neither would I embarrass them by questioning what they had left - the difference between the US and the UK maybe? Again will not recommend or return."
50,"Breakfast is served between 8-10am and it was perfect! All you can eat breakfast with option of pancakes, waffles and french toast. Drinks are also included in the deal. This was $21 each. Very reasonable for Times Square. Also was quiet so was perfect to look at memorabilia. Would recommend to go for breakfast if possible."
50,"Had dinner in here with my daughter and granddaughter. Was very very busy but the food was fast, perfectly cooked and plentiful. The drinks also very tasty."
40,"Expect to wait... but decent food typically priced for New York City. Can skip the line if you sit at the bar - otherwise depending on time and day - 35-60 min wait Service is pretty quick for as many tables they have - expect a little NUC attitude. Music videos playing throughout - steak is good, Mac and cheese is good, burgers seem fresh made - all around nice iconic place to visit"
40,"Was on our '' to do '' list and didn't let us down. You are given a devise that alerts you when your table is ready and while you wait you can view the music memorabilia displays so your wait should not be very long. Service was excellent, I believe our waiter was called Erwin  The food choice was very good, I recommend the ''Legendary Burger'' and my wife the ''Big Cheese Burger'' washed down with a small and pint of Stella larger (the pint being mine)  Fully recommend the experience"
50,"I must admit, the whole family is crazy about the Cafe and we always visit, when there is one around. Nearly 30 years ago, I visited one of my first Hard Rocks here in New York but it was up on 57th, if I am correct. Now at Times Square it is a crazy house. Tons of Tourists a huge shop and also a large Restaurant. We had to wait for 1 hour for a table but that was to expect. We love it but if you like a quiet place, keep away.  We enjoeyed it, as the other HRC we went and will continue to visit them."
50,"you have to go in time to get a table but it's worth it, the special hamburger is delicious as well as the tortillas with dissolved cheese and a very good attention"
40,"A very good meal of fajitas, ribs and salads. The only issue was the dressing missed from all three salads but it was put right quickly. Good service. The ribs were amazing. Really enjoyed."

We had to wait as we were told there weren’t any tables ready, despite there being plenty of empty tables visible. The options are to wander around the shop (do they make you wait in the hope you’ll buy something here) or get a drink from the bar. The bar surprisingly doesn’t serve half pints (which is a bit cheeky) and there are very few seats (which are grubby) so maybe another ploy to get you to go in the shop? The food was good, I really enjoyed my burger although the meal was expensive....$90 for 2 burgers and 4 drinks. Overall, we came away feeling underwhelmed."
10,"Visited Hard Rock Cafe for Christmas Day dinner during a trip to NYC. Booked before hand and received welcoming emails confirming the booking & the Christmas menu on offer. There was no festive spirit when we arrived. Our waitress had the often encountered surly New York attitude and we felt little more than an inconvenience. When I asked about the Christmas menu advertised this was curtly dismissed as “not available here.” The food was a mixture of bland burgers & steaks. Drinks menu was limited and they could not wait to get us to the dessert menu and out of the building. Very poor value. No Christmas cheer meant no tip. NYC has many many more options, Hard Rock Cafe is an appalling gimmick, and not a very good one at that."
